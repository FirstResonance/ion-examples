"""
This script shows how to get the steps in a run and attach a file to
that run. In this example, we are simply uploading the file to the first step
in the run. In application, you will want to identify the step by title or position
and upload the file to that step accordingly.

The ion file code flow is the following:
1. Get a pre-signed secure URL from the ion API
2. Upload file to the S3 location at the secure URL using HTTP PUT
