# Inventory export
Use this script to export all inventories with build requirement information.


## Setup
1. Add a `config.py` to this directory and store your ION API key information there. Check out `config_example.py` for the format
2. Run `python3 export_inventories_with_abom/export_inventories.py`
3. Follow along with the `log.txt` file for progress
4. When completed, the script will output a `inventories_with_abom.csv` file in the same directory
